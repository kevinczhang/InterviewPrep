Given an array will have either a valley or a mountain, only one, not one of each, find out the index of the valley or peak element
And with one more assumption: array[i - 1] = array[i] + 1 or array[i - 1] = array[i] - 1.
Example 1: [1,2,3,4,3,2,1] --> return 3
Example 2: [6,5,4,3,2,3,4] --> return 4
